📈 Storytelling Approach
✅ Steps Followed
1. Chose the Right Chart Types
   - Bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, maps, and KPI cards were used based on the data type and purpose.

2. Clean and Clear Visuals  
   - Avoided over-cluttering, used a consistent color scheme and font styles.

3. Added Context
   - Titles, labels, and tooltips were used to provide clarity and context to each chart.

4. Business Focused
   - Focused on answering key questions like:
     - Which region has the highest sales?
     - Which category is most profitable?
     - Which customer segment needs attention?

5. Summary Slide
   - Created a final dashboard slide that brings together all insights in a single view.

📊 Insights Discovered
Despite high sales, categories like ‘Tables’ show negative profit margins. Technology leads in both sales and profitability. Discount-heavy items often correlate with reduced profit.
